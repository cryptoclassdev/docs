## How Rewards Work

Staking rewards on Solana are generated through network inflation and distributed to validators and their delegators based on performance and stake weight.

### Reward Sources

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="coins" title="Network Inflation">
    Solana's current inflation rate is approximately 6.5% annually. This creates
    new SOL tokens that are distributed as staking rewards to maintain network
    security.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="receipt" title="Transaction Fees">
    A portion of transaction fees collected by the network is also distributed
    as rewards to validators and their delegators.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Validator Performance">
    Rewards are distributed based on validator uptime, block production, and
    network participation. Higher performance means more rewards.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Reward Calculation

### Basic Formula

Your staking rewards are calculated using this formula:

```
Your Rewards = (Your Stake / Total Validator Stake) × Validator Rewards × (1 - Commission)
```

### Detailed Breakdown

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Your Stake" icon="coins">
    The amount of SOL you've delegated to Validator.com. Larger stakes receive
    proportionally more rewards.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Validator Performance" icon="gauge">
    Our validator's uptime, block production rate, and network participation
    directly impact total rewards earned.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Commission Rate" icon="percent">
    We charge 5% commission on rewards, which is competitive and covers
    operational costs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Network Conditions" icon="globe">
    Overall network performance and inflation rate affect the total reward pool
    available.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Reward Distribution

### Epoch System

Solana operates on epochs (approximately 2 days each):

1. **Epoch Start**: New epoch begins
2. **Block Production**: Validators produce blocks and vote
3. **Performance Calculation**: Network calculates validator performance
4. **Reward Distribution**: Rewards distributed at epoch end
5. **Next Epoch**: Process repeats

### Distribution Timeline

<Info>
  **Reward Timeline:** - **Epoch Duration**: ~2 days - **Reward Calculation**:
  End of each epoch - **Distribution**: Automatic to stake accounts - **First
  Rewards**: 1-2 epochs after delegation - **Compound Effect**: Rewards can be
  automatically restaked
</Info>

## Factors Affecting Rewards

### Network-Level Factors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="globe" title="Network Inflation">
    Solana's inflation rate affects the total reward pool. Currently at ~6.5%
    annually, decreasing over time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="users" title="Total Network Stake">
    As more SOL is staked across the network, individual rewards may decrease
    due to dilution.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="chart-bar" title="Network Performance">
    Overall network health and performance can impact reward distribution
    mechanisms.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Validator-Level Factors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="gauge" title="Uptime Performance">
    Our validator's uptime directly impacts rewards. Higher uptime = more
    rewards.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="cube" title="Block Production">
    Consistent block production and voting participation maximizes reward
    potential.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="scale" title="Total Validator Stake">
    Our validator's total stake affects our share of network rewards.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Individual Factors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="coins" title="Your Stake Amount">
    Larger stakes receive proportionally more rewards, but smaller stakes still
    earn competitive returns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Staking Duration">
    Longer staking periods allow for compound growth and consistent reward
    accumulation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="sync" title="Restaking Strategy">
    Automatically restaking rewards can increase overall returns through
    compound growth.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Monitoring Your Rewards

### Wallet Dashboards

Most Solana wallets provide built-in reward tracking:

- **Current Rewards**: Pending rewards from current epoch
- **Historical Data**: Past reward distributions
- **Performance Metrics**: Validator uptime and performance
- **Projected Returns**: Estimated future rewards

### Validator.com Dashboard

Our dedicated dashboard provides detailed analytics:

1. **Visit**: [dashboard.validator.com](https://dashboard.validator.com)
2. **Enter**: Your wallet address
3. **View**: Detailed staking information
4. **Track**: Performance metrics and rewards

### Command Line Monitoring

```bash
# Check stake account balance
solana balance <stake-account-keypair>

# View detailed stake account info
solana stake-account <stake-account-keypair>

# Check validator performance
solana validators --output json | grep ValidatorCom1234567890abcdef
```

## Reward Optimization

### Maximizing Returns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Compound Staking">
    Automatically restaking rewards can increase overall returns through
    compound growth over time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Long-term Staking">
    Longer staking periods allow for consistent reward accumulation and compound
    growth.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="balance-scale" title="Optimal Stake Amount">
    Staking 1+ SOL typically provides optimal reward-to-fee ratios and better
    performance tracking.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Risk Management

<Warning>
  **Important Considerations:** - Rewards are not guaranteed and depend on
  network and validator performance - Commission rates may change with advance
  notice - Network conditions can affect reward distribution - Past performance
  doesn't guarantee future results
</Warning>

## Tax Considerations

### Reward Taxation

<Info>
  **Tax Information:** - Staking rewards are generally considered taxable income
  - Rewards are typically taxed when received - Keep detailed records of all
  reward transactions - Consult a tax professional for specific guidance - Use
  tools like Koinly or CoinTracker for tax reporting
</Info>

### Record Keeping

Maintain records of:

- Initial stake amounts
- Reward distributions
- Commission fees paid
- Unstaking transactions
- Transaction timestamps and amounts

## Troubleshooting Rewards

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="question-circle" title="No Rewards Received">
    **Possible Causes:** - Recently delegated (wait 1-2 epochs) - Validator
    temporary downtime - Network-wide issues **Solutions:** - Wait 2-3 epochs
    for first rewards - Check validator status - Monitor network status
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="exclamation-triangle" title="Lower Than Expected Rewards">
    **Possible Causes:** - Network performance issues - Increased total network
    stake - Validator performance dip **Solutions:** - Check network status -
    Review validator metrics - Compare with historical averages
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Delayed Reward Distribution">
    **Possible Causes:** - Network congestion - Epoch boundary delays -
    Technical issues **Solutions:** - Wait for next epoch - Check network status
    - Contact support if persistent
