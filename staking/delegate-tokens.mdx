<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="check-circle" title="Wallet Verification">
    In your wallet's staking section:
    - Your stake should show as "Active"
    - Validator should display as "Validator.com"
    - Commission should show 5%
    - Rewards should start accumulating after 1-2 epochs
  </Accordion>

    ```

</AccordionGroup>

## Managing Your Stake

   ```

2. **Merge Stake Accounts** (Optional)
   ```bash
   # Merge stake accounts
   solana merge-stake ~/.config/solana/stake-account.json ~/.config/solana/stake-account-2.json
   ```

### Withdrawing Stake

To withdraw your stake:

<Warning>
  **Important**: Withdrawing stake takes 2-3 days (cooling-off period) before
  tokens become available.
</Warning>

```bash
# Deactivate stake account
solana deactivate-stake ~/.config/solana/stake-account.json

# Wait for cooling-off period (2-3 days)

# Withdraw stake
solana withdraw-stake ~/.config/solana/stake-account.json <destination-wallet>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="exclamation-triangle" title="Transaction Failed">
    **Possible Causes:** - Insufficient SOL for transaction fees - Network
    congestion - Invalid validator identity **Solutions:** - Ensure you have at
    least 0.01 SOL for fees - Retry transaction during less busy periods -
    Double-check validator identity
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Stake Not Active">
    **Possible Causes:** - Delegation still processing - Validator temporarily
    offline - Network issues **Solutions:** - Wait 1-2 epochs for activation -
    Check validator status - Monitor network status
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="question-circle" title="No Rewards">
    **Possible Causes:** - Stake recently delegated - Validator performance
    issues - Network-wide issues **Solutions:** - Wait 2-3 epochs for first
    rewards - Check validator performance metrics - Monitor network status
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### Security Tips

<Warning>
  **Security Best Practices:** - Never share your private keys or seed phrases -
  Always verify validator identity before staking - Use official wallet
  applications only - Enable two-factor authentication where available - Keep
  your wallet software updated - Use hardware wallets for large amounts
</Warning>

### Optimization Tips

- **Stake Amount**: Consider staking 1+ SOL for optimal rewards
- **Timing**: Stake during low network congestion for lower fees
- **Monitoring**: Regularly check validator performance
- **Diversification**: Consider multiple validators for risk management
