## What is Staking?

Staking is the process of delegating your SOL tokens to a validator to help secure the Solana network and earn rewards in return. When you stake with Validator.com, you're contributing to network security while earning passive income.

### How Staking Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="shield-check" title="Network Security">
    By staking your SOL tokens, you're helping to secure the Solana blockchain.
    Validators use staked tokens to participate in consensus and validate
    transactions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="coins" title="Reward Generation">
    Stakers earn rewards from network inflation and transaction fees. These
    rewards are distributed proportionally based on your stake amount and
    validator performance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Epoch System">
    Solana operates on epochs (approximately 2 days). Rewards are calculated and
    distributed at the end of each epoch based on validator performance.

## Understanding Rewards

### Reward Calculation

Staking rewards are calculated using the following formula:

```
Reward = (Your Stake / Total Validator Stake) × Validator Rewards × (1 - Commission)
```

### Factors Affecting Rewards

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Network Inflation">
    Solana's current inflation rate is approximately 6.5% annually. This creates
    the base reward pool for all validators.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="gauge" title="Validator Performance">
    Our validator's uptime, block production rate, and network participation
    directly impact reward distribution.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="percent" title="Commission Rate">
    We charge a 5% commission on rewards, which is competitive in the market and
    covers operational costs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="scale" title="Stake Weight">
    Your rewards are proportional to your stake relative to our total validator
    stake.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Expected Returns

Based on current network conditions:

- **Annual Percentage Yield (APY)**: 7-8%
- **Daily Rewards**: ~0.02% of staked amount
- **Epoch Rewards**: ~0.04% of staked amount
- **Compound Effect**: Rewards can be automatically restaked

## Risk Considerations

### Understanding Risks

<Warning>
  **Important Risk Information:** - **Slashing Risk**: Minimal on Solana (rare
  penalty for malicious behavior) - **Validator Downtime**: Temporary loss of
  rewards during downtime - **Network Risk**: General blockchain and
  cryptocurrency risks - **Commission Changes**: Validator may adjust commission
  rates with notice
</Warning>
