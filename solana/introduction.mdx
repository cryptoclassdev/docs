### What is Solana?

Solana is a public blockchain platform. Think of it like a global digital ledger that anyone can use to build applications or exchange value without relying on a single company or bank.\
Unlike older blockchains that can get slow and expensive when lots of people use them, Solana was designed from the start to be fast and low-cost.

### Who started it and why?

The project behind Solana began with Anatoly Yakovenko and his colleagues at the company Solana Labs, with help from Raj Gokal and others.\
Yakovenko’s idea emerged around 2017: How can a blockchain process thousands of transactions per second, settle quickly, and keep the cost of each transaction very low? \
Solana’s network launched its mainnet in March 2020. 

### What makes it different?

There are a few technical ideas behind Solana — here’s a simple version:

- **Proof of Stake (PoS)** – Many modern blockchains use this mechanism: holders of the native token (SOL) “stake” it as part of validating or securing the network. 
- **Proof of History (PoH)** – This is Solana’s special twist: it introduces a kind of cryptographic “clock” or timestamp that helps the network know the order of events before they’re fully processed. It’s like pre-ordering the queue to speed things up. \
  Because of these, Solana can handle many transactions very quickly, and with lower fees compared to some other blockchains. 

### Why it matters (even if you’re not into crypto)

- If you’ve ever used an app that felt slow or expensive because of “blockchain fees” or delays, the promise of Solana is to reduce those frictions.
- It opens up possibilities for new applications: things like digital marketplaces, tokenised assets, games that run on blockchain, or even financial services that don’t need traditional banks.
- For everyday users, it could mean faster, cheaper digital experiences when interacting with technology anchored in a blockchain.

### A few caveats (to keep in mind)

- “Faster” and “cheaper” are relative. The technology is still evolving, and there have been times when Solana’s network faced disruptions. 
- Just because something runs on Solana, or any blockchain,doesn’t guarantee it’s safe or well-designed. As always: explore carefully if you’re participating.
- As with all new tech, trade-offs exist (complexity, security, ecosystem maturity) and things can change quickly.

### In short

If you imagine a blockchain as a **digital “railway system”** for value, apps and data:

- Solana set out to build a **high-speed express line**, rather than a local commuter track.
- Founded by people who believed the “one-train-fits-all” model (old slower blockchains) wasn’t enough for the next generation of apps.
- And its promise: faster trips, lower ticket price (fees), open to more users building more things.
